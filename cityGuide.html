        What are the best destinations to visit in Bali?
    </h1>
    <p class="section1__para">
        The most popular and “complete” destinations in Bali are 3 Nusa Islands, Canggu, Ubud, Seminyak and Ulluwatu. Yet, there is no simple answer to this question, which is the best destination in Bali. Each is very different.
    </p>

<div class="section2">
    <h1 class="section1__heading"> Top Destinations in Bali

    </h1> 
    <p>
        These destinations are very well 
        developed, very popular and welcome
        millions of domestic and international tourists 
        every year. Amazing holiday destinations
        yet also at times crowded and with less 
        of the “authentic Bali flair”.

                Canggu (including Berawa) is Bali’s most up-and-coming 
                destination. There’s something for everyone, from 
                backpackers to party-goers to digital nomads and 
                spiritual seekers. Very popular among young travelers,
                and loved by many solo travelers. 
                You can find a good range of accommodation 
                choices, from budget friendly hostels to mid-class 
                hotels and resorts. Plenty of restaurants, 
                coffee shops, bars, beach clubs, gyms, spas, 
                and yoga studios. Burdened by its own success, 
                Canggu struggles with traffic congestion at times.
                If you can rent and ride a scooter, 
                you will be much better off getting around. 
                Great surf spots.

                Ubud is known as Bali’s cultural and artistic 
                center where people from all over the globe 
                come to attend seminars and workshops focused 
                on taking care of their mind, body, and soul and
                 finding more balance and well-being in all 
                 parts of their lives. Excellent location from
                which to explore Bali's center and north, 
                including its many surrounding temples, 
                waterfalls, and rice terraces. Many beautiful 
                small shops, cafes, boutiques and since decades,
                 Ubud is a magnet for spiritual seekers. 
                 Life is more calm here. 
                 Although there are many tourists from the 
                 south visiting Bali during the day, which 
                 crowds up the main streets. Don't forget to 
                 visit one of the traditional dance shows. 
                 Ubud is also popular among digital nomads 
                 due to its amazing coffee shops, co-working 
                 spaces, and healthy food options. The climate 
                 is significantly cooler than at the coast.

                Just 40-50 minutes away by speedboat-ferry, you’ll be transported onto the islands that reflect what Bali was like only several decades ago. Remote, mostly underdeveloped, but stunnning views over beautiful cliffs and white sandy beaches. When the mainland gets a bit too much, the Nusa islands are where people escape to for a quieter time to enjoy the tropical island life. The Nusa islands are also known for their top-of-world dive spots to find all kinds of marine wildlife such as sea turtles, dolphines, mola mola, and manta rays. Cozy Guest Houses and hotels, small cafes and restaurants and lots of “instagrammable” sightseeing spots.

                The south west coast of the Bukit Peninsular has white sandy beaches in Balangan, Padang Padang, and Bingin. Backpackers, surfers, and now digital nomads love it here. Pecatu, which is quieter and more laid back, is home to some of the best luxury villas in Bali, as well as upcoming 4-5 star resorts in Pecatu with a golf course.
