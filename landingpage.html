<div id="guide">
    <h1 class="guide_main_heading"> Bali Travel Guide ‚Äì Get Ready for the Island</h1>
    <p class="guide__para"> Bali needs no introduction ‚Äì the island has become a dream destination 
        for decades, starting with the tourism boom in the
        1980s. 
        The book (and movie) has arguably led to what 
        Bali is known for in the present day ‚Äì wellness 
        and spiritual healing, along with the beautiful
        beaches and nature.    
    </p>
    <img src="" alt="Bali ">
    <p class="guide__para">Bali is part of Indonesia, a predominantly Muslim country that does 
        not eat pork. It is exactly why Bali stood out with 83% of the island practicing Hinduism,
        and one of their best-known local cuisines is actually a pork dish ‚Äì Babi Guling, 
        which is a spit-roasted pig often served in the form of Nasi Campur (mixed rice).
        Although Balinese adheres to Hinduism, the religion found in Bali is different than the 
        rest of the world. Balinese Hinduism is a combination of the core beliefs of Hinduism as we 
        know that originated from India, mixed with Bali‚Äôs own traditional beliefs.
        This is perhaps why Bali is popular with domestic and foreign tourists alike ‚Äì 
        it is unique and you can‚Äôt find a place like Bali anywhere else in the world.

    <h1 class="guide_sub_heading">General Tips for Traveling in Bali</h1>
    <p class="guide_sub_para"> The main mistake travelers going to do when coming to 
        Bali is to not be prepared. Holidays can indeed turn into small 
        and big nightmares, because we are missing some tips and tricks 
        beforehand and have a lack of understanding o how things work. 
        Here are a few things I‚Äôve learned about Bali</p>
    <ol class="general__tips">
        <li>
            <h4 class="sub__head">Visa on Arrival in Bali </h4>
            <p> Travelers from eligible countries can obtain a Visa 
                on Arrival (VoA) when visiting Bali. 
                This visa permits a 30-day stay and can be extended 
                once for an additional 30 days. Requirements include 
                a passport valid for at least six months from the date
                 of arrival, a return or onward ticket, and payment 
                 of the visa fee, which is approximately Rp500,000. 
                 To expedite the process, visitors can apply for an 
                 electronic Visa on Arrival (e-VoA) online before 
                 their trip. </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
            <h4 class="sub__head">Money Changer ‚Äì Only go to legit money changers!</h4>
            <p class="sub__para"> There are plenty of money changers around the touristy area in Bali,
             but most of them WILL try to scam you. I‚Äôm talking about the ones on the side of the street. 
             They are not legit and you‚Äôll know this because they will advertise rates that are too good 
             to be true. The catch is that they charge hidden ‚Äúcommissions‚Äù. Or worse, they‚Äôll swipe some 
             of your notes away while pretending to count the bills using various tricks, and you might not
              realize it until you‚Äôve left the place.
            So to be safe, only change your money at legitimate places like the bank, or a real money changer 
            that looks like a shop (usually with a glass door front), or is located inside convenience stores.
             And always look up reviews on Google Maps before you visit!</p>

        <li> 
            <h4 class="sub__head"> Apps & Connectivity</h4>

            <p class="sub__para"> <b>Buy SIM card - </b>Make sure you have Data SIM</p>

            <p class="sub__para"> <b> Download GRAB app - </b>GRAB is the holy grail app and I proudly support them because 
                they are an Indonesian company. Aside from the car and bike service, GRAB provides a 
                bunch of other services such as food delivery, concierge delivery service, massage, shopping, etc.</p>
            <p class="sub__para"> <b> Plenty of Rental Options - </b>  Whether you're looking for a car or bike, Bali offers many 
            affordable rental services for easy exploration.</p>
    
        </li>

        <li> 
            <h4 class="sub__head"> Health</h4>
            <p class="sub__para"><b>Buy a mosquito repellent ‚Äì </b>Mosquitoes come out at night in Bali. 
            If you are loved by mosquitoes like me, the local brand Autan is the best! You can get this as a 
            lotion or a spray at any convenience store in Bali.</p>

            <p class="sub__para"><b> Avoid drinking tap water - </b> Drinking water from tap in Bali is not safe.
                 Always opt for bottled or filtered water to stay healthy during your trip.</p>

            <p class="sub__para"><b> Always Wear Sunscreen - </b> The tropical sun in Bali can be intense. 
                Apply sunscreen with SPF 50+ to protect your skin from sunburn and damage.</p>

            <p class="sub__para"><b> Carry a Cotton Scarf/Sarong - </b> It's versatile! Use it to protect 
                yourself from the sun, as a beach mat, or even to cover up when visiting temples.</p>

            <p class="sub__para"><b> Always Carry an Umbrella or Poncho - </b>Bali's weather can be unpredictable, 
                especially during the rainy season. Having an umbrella or poncho on hand can save you from
                 sudden downpours.</p>
